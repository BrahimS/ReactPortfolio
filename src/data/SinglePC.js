I wanted to create a brand image that reflects the role and work of Yvan, a simple, minimal but effective. From the beginning, a logotype was a good choice to start with. Best of the word 'paysagiste' which is the exact title of Yvan's work was not taken by others. I have chosen a cursive typeface, which is a way for me to bring out the rustic and ancient side of this profession, but also the beauty and the creativity. In order to push and show the creative work of my client, I transformed the letter E into a fork, one of the main tools for a gardner.",
